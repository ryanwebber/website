I'm currently finishing my education in the double degree program for computer
science and business at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier
University. My current goal is to explore fundamental and low level
technologies and seek positions where I can learn and use them. I have
experience working on high-performance C++ projects, web and mobile
development, as well as exploratory hardware and software projects. Most
recently I have been involved in contributing to C++ projects designed to
reconstruct and analyze link-layer network traffic, as well as building tools
for abstracting Ubuntu network configuration.

<br/>

I'm continuing to pursue challenging roles as a developer and encourage you to
reach out to me anytime.
